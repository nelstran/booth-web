        <p class="about">
            I am a University of Utah student pursuing a major in Computer Science, with a strong passion for full-stack development, mobile development, and cybersecurity. As part of the Booth capstone team, I contributed to developing a user-focused application designed to help students find study partners, enhancing their learning experience and expanding their networks.
            Outside of academics, I enjoy playing and watching football (soccer) and staying active by going to the gym, which helps me reduce stress and maintain focus. I also love traveling, exploring new food spots, and immersing myself in different cultures and experiences. These activities inspire my creativity and broaden my perspective on life.
            I am eager to apply my skills to projects that truly make a difference in society. I believe it’s essential to contribute to the future progression of humanity by developing innovations that improve lives and support the next generation.

        <p class="about">
            Hey! I am Brayden Neal, a computer science student at the University of Utah. Throughout college I have taken an interest in developing lots of ideas I have had one of them being Booth, our capstone. After college I plan on going into Robotic Process Automation for Great American Insurance Group, while working on app side projects on the side like continuing Booth. Other interest I have is snowboarding, coffee, sleeping, working out, and studying with friends. All the skills I honed with this degree I plan to contributing to practical parts in my life to make life easier. I am very thankful for my Booth team, it is now an app that I am proud to have been apart of making!

        <p class="about">
            Hello! My name is Leena and I am a Data Science Major. After this semester, I’m planning on continuing my educational career by getting a Master's degree in Artificial Intelligence. Outside of school, my interests include making art (I also have a minor in Drawing), traveling, reading, writing, and spending time with family and friends. During my time working on the Booth app, I worked as a front-end developer as well as the data scientist of my team. It was a fulfilling experience to apply what I have learned over the years as a student to this app. I enjoyed working with my teammates to create Booth, and I hope you enjoy using it!

        <p class="about">
            Hey there! I am Nelson Tran and I’m pursuing a major in Computer Science at the University of Utah. Aside from Booth, I’ve worked on many personal projects that involve Full Stack development, web development, and many more. I currently have a minor in Applied Mathematics but I plan on pursuing a major in the near future because I always want to improve myself and math has always been fascinating and intriguing to me. Outside of academia, I love rock climbing, doing creative works in many forms (3D animation, video editing, drawing), and I’m currently learning how to play Jazz Piano. For my capstone, I worked on bridging the Front-End and Back-End portion of our app and ensuring smooth and efficient communication between the two. Booth has really allowed me to utilize the fundamentals that I’ve learned throughout the years to the fullest.
