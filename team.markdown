### Team Member page

List the project "staff" with pictures, bio info, and a contact.
Create a 150-250 word Biography describing yourself.  List your degree, research/project affiliations (including capstone), interests, etc.
Add a head shot image.  (I would suggest having the first image on the left with the bio on the right, followed by the next image on the right and bio on the left, etc.)
Finally, add your contact info (e.g., an email address) and optionally a link to "Linkedin"
