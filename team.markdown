### Team Member page

List the project "staff" with pictures, bio info, and a contact.
Create a 150-250 word Biography describing yourself.  List your degree, research/project affiliations (including capstone), interests, etc.
Add a head shot image.  (I would suggest having the first image on the left with the bio on the right, followed by the next image on the right and bio on the left, etc.)
Finally, add your contact info (e.g., an email address) and optionally a link to "Linkedin"

        <p class="about">
            I am a University of Utah student pursuing a major in Computer Science, with a strong passion for full-stack development, mobile development, and cybersecurity. As part of the Booth capstone team, I contributed to developing a user-focused application designed to help students find study partners, enhancing their learning experience and expanding their networks.
            Outside of academics, I enjoy playing and watching football (soccer) and staying active by going to the gym, which helps me reduce stress and maintain focus. I also love traveling, exploring new food spots, and immersing myself in different cultures and experiences. These activities inspire my creativity and broaden my perspective on life.
            I am eager to apply my skills to projects that truly make a difference in society. I believe it’s essential to contribute to the future progression of humanity by developing innovations that improve lives and support the next generation.

        <p class="about">
            Hello! My name is Leena and I am a Data Science Major. After this semester, I’m planning on continuing my educational career by getting a Master's degree in Artificial Intelligence. Outside of school, my interests include making art (I also have a minor in Drawing), traveling, reading, writing, and spending time with family and friends. During my time working on the Booth app, I worked as a front-end developer as well as the data scientist of my team. It was a fulfilling experience to apply what I have learned over the years as a student to this app. I enjoyed working with my teammates to create Booth, and I hope you enjoy using it!

        <p class="about">
            Hey there! I am Nelson Tran and I’m pursuing a major in Computer Science at the University of Utah. Aside from Booth, I’ve worked on many personal projects that involve Full Stack development, web development, and many more. I currently have a minor in Applied Mathematics but I plan on pursuing a major in the near future because I always want to improve myself and math has always been fascinating and intriguing to me. Outside of academia, I love rock climbing, doing creative works in many forms (3D animation, video editing, drawing), and I’m currently learning how to play Jazz Piano. For my capstone, I worked on bridging the Front-End and Back-End portion of our app and ensuring smooth and efficient communication between the two. Booth has really allowed me to utilize the fundamentals that I’ve learned throughout the years to the fullest.
